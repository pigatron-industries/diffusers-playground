    ## Notes
    
    ** short prompt also works, but the result is much better after the caption is refined. **

    ### Caption Refining with In Context Learning(ICL)

    caption refining instruction example:
    ```
    Please generate the long prompt version of the short one according to the given examples. Long prompt version should consist of 3 to 5 sentences. Long prompt version must sepcify the color, shape, texture or spatial relation of the included objects. DO NOT generate sentences that describe any atmosphere!!!

    Short: A calico cat with eyes closed is perched upon a Mercedes.
    Long: a multicolored cat perched atop a shiny black car. the car is parked in front of a building with wooden walls and a green fence. the reflection of the car and the surrounding environment can be seen on the car's glossy surface.

    Short: A boys sitting on a chair holding a video game remote.
    Long: a young boy sitting on a chair, wearing a blue shirt and a baseball cap with the letter 'm'. he has a red medal around his neck and is holding a white game controller. behind him, there are two other individuals, one of whom is wearing a backpack. to the right of the boy, there's a blue trash bin with a sign that reads 'automatic party'.

    Short: A man is on the bank of the water fishing.
    Long: a serene waterscape where a person, dressed in a blue jacket and a red beanie, stands in shallow waters, fishing with a long rod. the calm waters are dotted with several sailboats anchored at a distance, and a mountain range can be seen in the background under a cloudy sky.

    Short: A kitchen with a cluttered counter and wooden cabinets.
    Long: a well-lit kitchen with wooden cabinets, a black and white checkered floor, and a refrigerator adorned with a floral decal on its side. the kitchen countertop holds various items, including a coffee maker, jars, and fruits.

    Short: a racoon holding a shiny red apple over its head
